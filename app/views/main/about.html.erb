            <em></em>Watercolor artist and Denver native, Lisa Luree has been immersed in the arts since she was able to hold a brush.
            Her mother recognized her daughter’s talents and actively participated in getting her not only instruction
            but the support that made her the artist she is today.<br></br>

            <em></em>Lisa’s painting range from her trademark skeletons, to fantasy creatures and nudes. 
            She lightens darker subject matters with vibrant colors and iridescent pigments that catch the light in a playful way.
            Sometimes pieces are carefully planned out but Luree also embraces the impromptu process – letting images form as she goes.
            She believes that letting creativity flow unobstructed allows an artist to tap the collective unconscious and draw archetypal symbolism into the art.<br>

            <em></em>It is no surprise that her biggest influence come from her family and friends.
            Besides the encouragement from her mother, she had a superstitious china painting teacher who opened up Lisa’s mind to fantasy and exploration of the imagination; 
            and her husband -whose mechanical ingenuity and keen sense of the obvious has helped her hone the final product.<br>
